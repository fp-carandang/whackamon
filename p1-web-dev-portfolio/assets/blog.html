      <p>
        
        Last night, after writing codes, I decide to level-up my Dragon Knight character
        in Ragnarok Online. I started out killing monster mobs in Abyss Lake dungeon with
        my character's Dragon Breath skill.

      </p>

      <p>
      
        After hitting level 220, I set out to do a boss monster run. I headed to town for
        a free buff for my character before returning to Abyss Lake dungeon level 3 to hunt
        Detardelier, the dragon boss monster MVP.

      </p>

      <p>

        Struggling for quite a bit, I managed to learn how to time my Dragon Breath skill and
        Hundred Spear skill to optimize my damage per second. Partnered with Servant Weapon active,
        my normal attacks have a chance to trigger an area of effect damage, taking care of the mob
        spawned by the Detardelier. And after fifteen minutes of intense keyboard button spamming,
        I managed to defeat the dragon boss monster.

      </p>

      <p>

        It dropped one Fire Scale, and an unknown headgear (later identified as a Coronet using Magnifier
        item). The mobs it spawned dropped a combined five Three-Headed Dragon Head, ten Red Bijous, six
        Yellow Bijous, four Blue Bijous, seven Green Bijous, three unknown hats, two unknown helmets (identified
        as Magni's Cap and Morrigane's Helmet respectively), twenty White Herbs, thirty Dragon Scale, fourteen
        Dragon Skin, fifty one Dragon Claw, and a Panacea.

      </p>

      <p>

        After the hunt, I proceeded to a generated instance dungeon where the Niflheim map is besieged by MVP monsters.
        Several niche monsters with ability to summon mobs were also present.

      </p>

      <p>

        First encounter in this instance were the MVP insect monsters of Mistress and Maya. They are weak against Fire
        element attacks but together, they proved to be difficult to face at the same time. Mistress keeps spamming her
        Jupitel Thunder skill, which knocks back my character while taking damage and then Teleports away from the fight.
        With the timing between my Hundred Spear and Dragon Breath (Fire) skill in mind, I disposed of Mistress in ten
        minutes and twenty three seconds.

      </p>

      <p>

        Maya proved to be easier as I disposed of the MVP boss monster in just under seven minutes combining my two skills
        and the passive/reactive Servant Weapon skill.

      </p>

      <p>

        Next encounter was the MVP Doppelganger. It summons Nightmares as its mob spawns. It also has the skill Ignition
        Break, an area of effect damage skill that really hurt my character when I got too close, too often. I opted for a
        hit and run tactic with the Doppelganger, casting Dragon Breath and Hundred Spear then hightailing out of its attack
        range and after the skill cooldown, hit it until it met its demise in under fifteen minutes.

      </p>

      <p>

        I then had an encounter with the MVP Baphomet. It spawns Baphomet Jr. and is really quick. I stocked up on White Syrups
        for HP (hit point) restoration while I up my attack speed and hit Baphomet with normal attacks coupled with the reactive
        skill Servant Weapon. Baphomet went down after fifteen minutes and thirty one seconds.

      </p>

      <p>

        After killing four MVP monsters, the next one I encountered was Moonlight. It is a fire element monster thereby nullifying
        the damage of my Dragon Breath completely. It was a good thing I invested skill points in its counterpart, the Dragon Water
        Breath skill, and Moonlight was eliminated in just under three minutes.

      </p>

      <p>

        Next one was the Atroce MVP, a werewolf boss monster with high physical damage resistance and an even higher physical damage
        counter. I had trouble damaging this boss monster as only seventy five percent of my damage is counted as final damage to its
        hit points. After getting close to death a few times and exhausting most of my potion supply, Atroce went down after a staggering
        thirty one minutes twenty seven seconds.

      </p>

      <p>

        The final boss encounter to be had on this instance was Dark Lord. It is a sort of a demon/spellcaster being with high physical and
        magical damage resistance and a high magical damage counter. Being a knight class character, I have a high tolerance against physical
        attack damage, but very little defense against magical attacks. This proved to be the bane of my Dragon Knight character, no matter
        how many attempts I had, combining all techniques and skills at my character's disposal, I still get killed by Dark Lord in mere seconds.
        After fifty nine attempts, I accepted defeat and relinquished the chance to finish the instance dungeon.

      </p>

      <p>

        My spoils were quite lucrative from this MVP hunt. Significant loot items include a Spiky Headband, a Gungnir spear, and a Bastard Sword
        from Doppelganger. Mistress dropped a Coronet, an Old Card Album that gave me a Zerom Card (which is useless). Maya dropped her MVP card
        which sold for a decent price at the market. Atroce also dropped its MVP card which I decided to compound to an equipment I plan to use
        on a character I will be creating soon. Baphomet dropped a Cresent Scythe, an armor I forgot what was, and an Old Card Album that gave me
        a Sohee Card (I plan to use it on a Mage character).
